# IPSW Downloader
This script polls the IPSW.me API and builds a list of files for aria2 to download. To run this, you will need Ruby, and Aria2. Included are `device.yml` (device mappings), and `firmwares.yml` (device firmware URLs). Big thanks to IPSW.me for providing the API. If you want to update the device or firmware list simply remove both `yml` files and run the script again

This script was inspired by [this post on r/jailbreak](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/deshn3/discussion_got_bored_so_i_created_a_backup_of/)
